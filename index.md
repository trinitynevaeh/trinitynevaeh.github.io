I am a Computer Science Major at CSUF and I supposed to be graduating in 2027, but the goal is to graduate as early as I can!

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5
I really enjoyed Lab 5 for many different reasons. The first reason is because my partner for this lab was really great! They were nice, extremely helpful if I did nor understand something, and helped me understand the lab better. Another reason I really liked this lab is because I really enjoy for-loops. I liked learning about them, so applying for-loops in this lab was really fun and interesting to do. The lab was also sort of challenging at times, but being able to figure the challenging parts out made completing this lab very rewarding. 

Lab 7
Lab 7 was very fun to do because I really like doing the if else statements. I also enjoyed learning about this kind of code during lectures, so I was interested and excited to put them to use in this lab. This lab gave me a better understanding about if else statements, which made it a memorable lab for me. 

Lab 10
I liked this lab as well because it also still included if else statements. This lab was also very challenging to do, so completing this lab also made the lab much more rewarding and memorable. We also used for statements in the lab and I really enjoyed writing those. Part-2 was a little more difficult than part-1, which I liked because it made the lab more interesting to do.
